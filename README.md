Welcome to Section 3!
Here Michael Introduces what you will be covering in this section.

### What Is A Texture? ###

+ Critical part of setting up a material.
+ Blender and Unity accept textures to define different parameters of a material.
+ A Texture is a map of the qualities of a surface.
+ Typically these maps are image files.

### Image Fundamentals ###

+ Images are information- a series of 1s and 0s
+ Image dimensions should be a power of two
+ Imagine a single pixel image
+ This image is 2^1 on both sides
+ 1 bit pixel- either black or white

(Unique Video Reference: 2_TX_UAP )

### A Simple Texture ###

+ Many tools at our disposal, including pen and paper! (plus camera). GIMP/Photoshop/Paint!
+ Ideally the image’s resolution should be a power of 2 on both sides.
+ We’ll have a look at paint and discuss preview.

### UV Mapping ###

+ UV Mapping, is mapping the 2D Co-ordinates of an image onto a 3D Surface.
+ UV Unwrapping is getting the model ready.
+ There is no right or wrong, depends on the application and use.

### Normals ###

+ We will look at what a normal is
+ How we can see them in Blender
+ Turning on backface culling
+ Look at flat and smooth shading.

(Unique Video Reference: 5_TX_UAC)

### Normal Maps ###

+ A Normal Map is a type of Bump Map.
+ We will generate a normal maps from one of our existing black and white images in Unity.
+ Each Texel of a normal map represents a deviation from the face normal.

### Height Maps ###

+ Height maps: grayscale images, with black being the lowest point and white the highest.
+ They can fake the occlusion of parts of geometry.
+ In Unity they require a texture to have been used before hand, otherwise no effect.

### Naming Conventions ###

+ Discuss why naming is important.
+ CamelCaseIsReallyUseful
+ Use_Underscores_Rather_Than_Spaces
+ Stick to your convention
+ Be flexible.

### Unwrapping A Model ###

+ Build a Simple model
+ Unwrap it, placing manual seams.
+ UV Unwrapping is an art itself! There is no right or wrong way.
+ There are ways that will distort or look worse.

### Mapping A Single Texture ###

+ Map a texture to our model.
+ Turn on tiling in Blender for a better appreciation of what is happening.
+ Save our files in the Unity assets folder.

(Unique Video Reference: 10_TX_UAP)

### Mapping Multiple Textures ###

+ Map more than one image to a single model.
+ We’ll paint our own texture for this in Blender
+ Show you how to export a UV Map to paint in an external package.

### Presenting Your Model ###

In This Video…
+ Models look odd out of context
+ Build environment, either in Blender or Unity
+ Present you model in a better light.
